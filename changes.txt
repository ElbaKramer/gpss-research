# changed for using our cluster
source/cblparallel/pyfear.py

# modified python scripts
source/demo.py               # just commented out post processing part, this script does experiment specified in 'examples/fast_example.py' file
source/gpml.py               # modified 'OPTIMIZE_KERNEL_CODE' part for relational version
                             # 'OptimizerOutput' class to include normalizing parameters
                             # modified 'load_mat' function to load relational data (in cell array)
source/experiment.py         # made 'calc_data_shape' function with existing code for later use
                             # introduced 'relational' input argument for 'jc.evaluate_models' and 'Experiment' class
source/flexible_function.py  # introduced 'normal' field for 'GPModel' class to store nomalizing parameters
source/job_controller.py     # modified 'evaluate_models' function to deal with the relational version

# newly introduced gp functions
source/gpml/ext/gp_delta.m   # the original abcd version to deal with zero noise case (infDelta, likDelta)
source/gpml/ext/gp_rel_v1.m  # our first version of relational abcd (no scale parameter)
source/gpml/ext/gp_rel_v2.m  # second version, introduced two scale parameters for each sequence for addition and multiplication.
